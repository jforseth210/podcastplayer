# Podcast Player
This Kotlin program loads podcast data from podcast feeds.

Get started: 
```
git clone https://github.com/jforseth210/podcastinayearplayer
cd podcasinayearplayer
./gradlew run
```

If you already use a podcast app, you can export your feeds to an opml file and import them by clicking "Import OPML".
